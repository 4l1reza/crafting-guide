Oil is a naturally-occuring liquid added by BuildCraft. While it can be burned in a [Combustion Engine] to produce
30RF/t, it is much more adventageous to convert it to [1000mB Fuel] using a [Refinery] as fuel both produces more power
per tick and burns longer.

While not particularly common, Oil can be found in large spouts in ocean, desert, and swamp biomes. The spouts come in
different sizes, with the larger above-ground portion indicating larger oil deposits below ground. Each spout can
produce hundreds or even thousands of buckets of oil. The best way to remove oil is to use a [Pump] to extract it, and convert it directly into fuel.
