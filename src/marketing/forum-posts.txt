Title:

MAJOR UPDATE! Crafting Guideâ€”Ultimate step-by-step guide to make anything

Body:

Have you ever wanted to figure out how much of what materials you need to craft something? Ever notice that certain
recipes are pretty easy... until you account for all the machines you need? Ever wonder how much stuff you'll need to
make a [Quarry](http://crafting-guide.com/item/quarry) or an entire
[QuantumSuit](http://crafting-guide.com/quantumsuit_bodyarmor)?

Crafting Guide will help. Choose what you want to make and how many of each, and it will automatically figure out:

* How many of what resources do you need?
* What tools / machines do you need?
* How many of what resource do you need for the tools?
* What items do you need to craft in what order?

I've just launched a brand-new version with support for vanilla, Buildcraft, and IndustrialCraft2 (classic) recipes.
It's all open-source, so anyone can help expand it to cover missing recipes, other mods, or add new features. Check out
the [GitHub project](https://github.com/andrewminer/crafting-guide) if you'd like to get involved!

If you've seen it before, go look again. There's a whole new site now, which supports a lot more than the old one did:

* All items have matching icons
* All recipes show the proper layout on the crafting grid
* You now get step-by-step instructions
* You can now make many different items at once (e.g., a whole NanoSuit)

A few more updates to report!  First, now your preferences for which mods are active and whether tools are included
will be remembered between visits. Second, I've finished adding support for Thermal Expansion 4.  The crafting algorithm
doesn't yet taken into account the ore-doubling/tripling machinery, but all the recipes for the entire mod are present
and functional.  I'll work on using the machines in a future update.  Next up: IC2 Experimental!

I've just finished adding support for the latest version of Industrial Craft (2.2.663 on the experimental branch).  I've
also updated the site to let you select the version you're using.
