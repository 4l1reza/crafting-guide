                    Today, I finally reveal the new Crafting Guide website!  While there are only minor changes to the
                    outward appearance, a <i>lot</i> has changed under the covers.  First, you should notice that the
                    general appearance is more consistently "Minecraft" in feel, and everything is quite a bit faster.
                    You should also notice that it works a little bit better on mobile devices (much more on that to
                    come).  Finally, you'll notice that things are organized a bit better than they have been in the
                    past.
                p.
                    If you've used the site before, one thing which has disappeared is the "configure" page.  Now, to
                    say which mods you're using, just go to the individual mod pages and select the version of that mod
                    you've got in your mod pack directly. Just as before, the rest of the website will adjust to use the
                    version you select (or to ignore that mod if you select "no" version).

                    The second contribution comes from <a href="http://github.com/kythorn">Jay Oliver</a> who has
                    added the data files for <a href="/browse/quantum_flux">Quantum Flux</a>. Quantum Flux provides
                    various items for moving RF power wirelessly and manipulating the flow of time.  It also
                    provides some pretty powerful powered armor.
                p.
                    The third contribution, from <a href="http://github.com/ThePsionic">ThePsionic</a>, is a
                    BuildCraft add-on called <a href="/browse/logistics_pipes">Logistics Pipes</a>.  This mod adds
                    a whole complex set of pipes which allow automated retrieval, crafting, sorting, and more.

                    I've gotten a few contributions of whole mods recently, and I'm catching up on getting them up
                    on the site.  First up is <a href="/browse/agricraft">Agricraft</a>, contributed by
                    <a href="http://github.com/dragagon">dragagon</a>!  Agricraft takes the idea of crops from IC2
                    and pumps it up to a whole new level with a cross-breeding program that introduces a way to grow
                    anything from native Minecraft flowers all the way up to diamonds!

                    I've been using <a href="/browse/modular_powersuits">Modular PowerSuits</a> myself lately, and I
                    noticed that the newest version (finally!) comes with default recipes.  So, I've updated
                    Crafting Guide to support both the newest vanilla recipes as well as those from Thermal
                    Expansion.  You can switch back and forth on the <a href="/configure">Configure</a> page.

                    Back before the winter holidays, the extremely patient <a href="https://github.com/tdallmann">
                    tdallmann</a> completed support for <a href="/browse/hydraulicraft/">Hydraulicraft</a>, and I'm
                    afraid I'm only now getting it up on the site!  It looks like a neat mod based all around the
                    science of hydraulics with a nicely stepped set of devices to be made at each level. Many thanks
                    to tddallmann for adding it to Crafting Guide!
                p.
                    I also received a submission for adding <a href="/browse/opencomputers">OpenComputers</a> from
                    <a href="https://github.com/yut23">yut23</a>.  Should be a big help to those aspiring Minecraft
                    programmers who want a bit more challege than is provided by <a href="/browse/computercraft">
                    ComputerCraft</a>!  Thanks, yut23!

                    support for <a href="/browse/storage_drawers">Storage Drawers</a>!

                    I'm super excited to announce that I've added full multi-block support for Crafting Guide! For
                    example, check out a <a href="/browse/big_reactors/5_core_passive_reactor">5-Core Reactor</a>
                    from Big Reactors, or the <a href="/browse/railcraft/steel_tank_5x5x5">5x5x5 Steel Tank</a> from
                    Railcraft.  I'm really pleased with how it turned out!

                    Remember me?  They guy who runs the site.  Yeah, I'm back, and with big news!  The site now has
                    a completely new crafting algorithm.  Instead of just taking the first crafting plan it comes up
                    with, it tries to compute every possible plan, rates them, and then picks the best one.  This
                    also clears up a lot of bugs related to the old algorithm.  The one drawback is that some items
                    can take a bit longer to compute than with the old way, but I think you'll find it's worth it!
                p.
                    On a personal note, I think it's clear that I don't have nearly as much time to dedicate to the
                    site as I used to.  That's mostly because I started a new job which keeps me away from working
                    on the site so much.  I hope to be able to get into a more regular pace now things my personal
                    life has settled down again.

                    You may have noticed things have been very quiet with the site for the past month... well I'm
                    afraid that's because I haven't been working on it.  Instead, I've been hunting for a new job.
                    Now that I've got that all squared away (I'll be starting at Looker in Santa Cruz on Monday),
                    I'll have nights and weekends to continue working on the site.  Thanks for being patient!

                    Today I launched the second major part of the item description editor: image uploads! As you
                    enter your description, use the markdown notation for an image <tt>  ![](image.png)  </tt> and a
                    empty image preview will show up underneath the editor. Click the button to select an image from
                    your computer. Just be sure to keep the images to a reasonable size (< 750kB, and < 740px by
                    600px).

                    As of today, you can now add and edit item descriptions right on Crafting Guide. This feature is
                    starting small with just item descriptions, but eventually all the content on the site will be
                    editable. All you need is a (free) GitHub account, and you're ready to go!
                p.
                    For those more comfortable with a regular text editor, all the content is still in GitHub under
                    the <a href="https://github.com/andrewminer/crafting-guide-data">crafting-guide-data</a> repo.
                    Just follow the instructions, and you can submit content via pull request instead of using the
                    website's editor.

                    I've been working on a big new feature for a while now, but I didn't want to leave everyone
                    without anything new for so long... So, I've just finished adding <a
                    href="/browse/minefactory_reloaded">MineFactory Reloaded</a>! Enjoy!

                    Okay... big changes on the crafting page! Instead of having four little boxes for the various
                    parts of the crafting plan, the new page shows all the steps as one long list.  In addition, you
                    get a lot more control over the plan. Now, you can even mark individual steps as complete to get
                    a new crafting plan which doesn't include those items.
                p.
                    As an example, let's say you're thinking about upgrading your <a
                    href="/browse/simply_jetpacks/reinforced_jetpack">Reinforced Jetpack</a> to a shiny new <a
                    href="/browse/simply_jetpacks/resonant_jetpack">Resonant Jetpack</a>, you can just mark off the
                    step for the Reinforced Jetpack, and get only the materials and steps for doing the upgrade.
                    I'm really pleased with the new crafting page, and I think you're going to love it!

                    I've just finished adding <a href="/browse/simply_jetpacks">Simply Jetpacks</a> by Tonius.  It
                    seems like a simple mod on the surface, but what with all the upgrades and technology tiers, it
                    takes an amazing <a href="/craft/flux_infused_jetplate">87 steps</a> to make the highest-tier
                    jetpack!
                p.
                    I've also added <a href="/browse/solar_flux">Solar Flux</a> by Nauktis. Again, another
                    deceptively simple mod, but the <a href="/browse/solar_flux/solar_panel_vi/">most powerful solar
                    panel</a> kicks out an impressive 4096 RF/t! I just hope your mine has been productive... among
                    other things, you'll need 45 Diamonds, 110 Gold Ore, 1568 Copper Ore, and 6023 Iron Ore!
