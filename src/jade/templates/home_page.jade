                        Crafting Guide is the ultimate resource for Minecraft. Whether you're punching trees or building
                        reactors, you'll find Crafting Guide indispensable.

                        I've gotten a few contributions of whole mods recently, and I'm catching up on getting them up
                        on the site.  First up is <a href="/browse/agricraft">Agricraft</a>, contributed by
                        <a href="http://github.com/dragagon">dragagon</a>!  Agricraft takes the idea of crops from IC2
                        and pumps it up to a whole new level with a cross-breeding program that introduces a way to grow
                        anything from native Minecraft flowers all the way up to diamonds!

                        I've been using <a href="/browse/modular_powersuits">Modular PowerSuits</a> myself lately, and I
                        noticed that the newest version (finally!) comes with default recipes.  So, I've updated
                        Crafting Guide to support both the newest vanilla recipes as well as those from Thermal
                        Expansion.  You can switch back and forth on the <a href="/configure">Configure</a> page.

                        Back before the winter holidays, the extremely patient <a href="https://github.com/tdallmann">
                        tdallmann</a> completed support for <a href="/browse/hydraulicraft/">Hydraulicraft</a>, and I'm
                        afraid I'm only now getting it up on the site!  It looks like a neat mod based all around the
                        science of hydraulics with a nicely stepped set of devices to be made at each level. Many thanks
                        to tddallmann for adding it to Crafting Guide!
                    p.
                        I also received a submission for adding <a href="/browse/opencomputers">OpenComputers</a> from
                        <a href="https://github.com/yut23">yut23</a>.  Should be a big help to those aspiring Minecraft
                        programmers who want a bit more challege than is provided by <a href="/browse/computercraft">
                        ComputerCraft</a>!  Thanks, yut23!

                        With many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/pkmnfrk">Mike Caron</a>, I'm pleased to announce
                        support for <a href="/browse/storage_drawers">Storage Drawers</a>!

                        I'm super excited to announce that I've added full multi-block support for Crafting Guide! For
                        example, check out a <a href="/browse/big_reactors/5_core_passive_reactor">5-Core Reactor</a>
                        from Big Reactors, or the <a href="/browse/railcraft/steel_tank_5x5x5">5x5x5 Steel Tank</a> from
                        Railcraft.  I'm really pleased with how it turned out!

                        requested mod, and it's finally here!  Enjoy!

                        Remember me?  They guy who runs the site.  Yeah, I'm back, and with big news!  The site now has
                        a completely new crafting algorithm.  Instead of just taking the first crafting plan it comes up
                        with, it tries to compute every possible plan, rates them, and then picks the best one.  This
                        also clears up a lot of bugs related to the old algorithm.  The one drawback is that some items
                        can take a bit longer to compute than with the old way, but I think you'll find it's worth it!
                    p.
                        On a personal note, I think it's clear that I don't have nearly as much time to dedicate to the
                        site as I used to.  That's mostly because I started a new job which keeps me away from working
                        on the site so much.  I hope to be able to get into a more regular pace now things my personal
                        life has settled down again.

                        You may have noticed things have been very quiet with the site for the past month... well I'm
                        afraid that's because I haven't been working on it.  Instead, I've been hunting for a new job.
                        Now that I've got that all squared away (I'll be starting at Looker in Santa Cruz on Monday),
                        I'll have nights and weekends to continue working on the site.  Thanks for being patient!

                        Today I launched the second major part of the item description editor: image uploads! As you
                        enter your description, use the markdown notation for an image <tt>  ![](image.png)  </tt> and a
                        empty image preview will show up underneath the editor. Click the button to select an image from
                        your computer. Just be sure to keep the images to a reasonable size (< 750kB, and < 740px by
                        600px).

                    p.
                        As of today, you can now add and edit item descriptions right on Crafting Guide. This feature is
                        starting small with just item descriptions, but eventually all the content on the site will be
                        editable. All you need is a (free) GitHub account, and you're ready to go!
                    p.
                        For those more comfortable with a regular text editor, all the content is still in GitHub under
                        the <a href="https://github.com/andrewminer/crafting-guide-data">crafting-guide-data</a> repo.
                        Just follow the instructions, and you can submit content via pull request instead of using the
                        website's editor.

                        I've been working on a big new feature for a while now, but I didn't want to leave everyone
                        without anything new for so long... So, I've just finished adding <a
                        href="/browse/minefactory_reloaded">MineFactory Reloaded</a>! Enjoy!

                h3 2015-04-20
                .entry
                    p.
                        Okay... big changes on the crafting page! Instead of having four little boxes for the various
                        parts of the crafting plan, the new page shows all the steps as one long list.  In addition, you
                        get a lot more control over the plan. Now, you can even mark individual steps as complete to get
                        a new crafting plan which doesn't include those items.
                    p.
                        As an example, let's say you're thinking about upgrading your <a
                        href="/browse/simply_jetpacks/reinforced_jetpack">Reinforced Jetpack</a> to a shiny new <a
                        href="/browse/simply_jetpacks/resonant_jetpack">Resonant Jetpack</a>, you can just mark off the
                        step for the Reinforced Jetpack, and get only the materials and steps for doing the upgrade.
                        I'm really pleased with the new crafting page, and I think you're going to love it!

                        I've just finished adding <a href="/browse/simply_jetpacks">Simply Jetpacks</a> by Tonius.  It
                        seems like a simple mod on the surface, but what with all the upgrades and technology tiers, it
                        takes an amazing <a href="/craft/flux_infused_jetplate">87 steps</a> to make the highest-tier
                        jetpack!
                    p.
                        I've also added <a href="/browse/solar_flux">Solar Flux</a> by Nauktis. Again, another
                        deceptively simple mod, but the <a href="/browse/solar_flux/solar_panel_vi/">most powerful solar
                        panel</a> kicks out an impressive 4096 RF/t! I just hope your mine has been productive... among
                        other things, you'll need 45 Diamonds, 110 Gold Ore, 1568 Copper Ore, and 6023 Iron Ore!
