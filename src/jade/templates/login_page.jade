        h1 Login with GitHub
        p.
            Use your GitHub credentials to login and make changes on Crafting Guide. No GitHub account? Don't worry, you
            can get one for free. <a class="read-more" href="#">read more...</a>
        .read-more-content.slideable.closed
            p.
                All changes you make on the site get submitted directly to our GitHub repo, and then published through
                the same automated deployment process as changes made by anyone else. That way, anyone can contribute
                easily: whether developer or end user.
            p.
                To log in, we redirect you to GitHub's site, and once you're signed in, they'll send you back here. We
                never see your credentials, and only get the minimum set of permissions necessary to submit changes to
                the Crafting Guide repo on your behalf.
            p.
                GitHub offers free accounts, so even if you don't already have one, you've got nothing to lose!

            Our interactive editing service is down right now, but you can always submit a pull request over at
            the <a href="https://github.com/andrewminer/crafting-guide">Crafting Guide GitHub Repository</a>. We'll have
            the editing service back up soon!
